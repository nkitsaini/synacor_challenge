**For soft hints see:** https://github.com/Gyebro/synacor-challenge#spoiler-free-hints  

**Here are more concrete hints:**
- 1. Read the arch
- 2. Ready hints from arch and implement the hinted operations. Run the binary
- 3. Implement all the operation as specified by the arch
- 4. Run the binary and play around in the game. (hint1: take and use) (hin2: type jibberish in game)
- 5. Play around. Use `drop` to mark locations. Maybe implement some sort of saving mechanism for game (I went with manually typing/copy pasting for this part)
- 6. Solve the equations, coins to rescue.
- 7. Just read the game run logs (operation, registers, curr memory location etc.), and build the checker. bypass the checker in game.
- 8. First of all physics works here, north means north unlike previous areas. Second find shortest path in graph. Third It's a **mirror**
