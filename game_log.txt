9 + 2 * 5 ^2 + 7 ^3 - 3 = 399


8th:
31 = (22 + 4*(2)) *8 - 11*(19)
- Go all north (shuffle between north/south for +4)
- go to east until `-`
- shuffle between south/north (for -11)
- go to vault (31-1 = 30)
* Still orb disappears (Maybe need to go through different route?)


route1: north -> north -> north -> east -> east -> vault
route2: north -> east -> east -> east -> north -> north  -> vault
route3: east -> east -> east -> north -> north -> north -> vault
